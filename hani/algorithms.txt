register a place holder for 3 values
ask the user for 3 values

start with value at index (1):

if value at index(1) less than value at index(2) but greater than value at index(3) its a middle value
if value at index(1) greater than value at index(2) but less than value at index(3) its a middle value


start with value at index(2):

if value at index(2) less than value at index(1) but greater than value at index(3) its a middle value
if value at index(2) greater than value at index(1) but less than value at index(3) its a middle value

start with value at index(3):

if value at index(3) less than value at index(1) but greater than value at index(2) its a middle value
if value at index(3) greater than value at index(1) but less than value at index(2) its a middle value



or 

register a place holder for 3 values
ask the user for 3 values
register a plae holder for a min and max value
find min value (for loop)
find max value (for loop)
the value not the min or max is the mean value





or 

sort the array in accending order ---> Bubble sort
take value at index (1) as its always the mean value
